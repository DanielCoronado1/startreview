    [1, 'Zelda', 'public/img/zelda.jpeg', 'public/videos/Zelda.mp4', 'The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is an action-adventure game for the Wii video game console. Developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development with the collaboration of Monolith Soft. It was released on November 18, 2011 in Europe and on November 20, 2011 in the Americas. The game uses the mandatory Wii MotionPlus peripheral. It will be sold with a gold Wii Remote Plus or standalone and both will include a CD with orchestrated pieces from the franchise in the first units. Skyward Sword is an action-adventure video game in which players assume the role of series protagonist Link through a world populated by monsters and dungeons. The player controls Link in a third-person perspective and in a three-dimensional space. In terms of structure and development the game is linear. Link can run short distances, but other actions such as sprinting, climbing and carrying heavy objects are limited by a stamina meter, which recharges after a few seconds when he does not perform actions that deplete it.When it is completely depleted, Links movement speed is reduced and he cannot use his weapons until the meter is recharged. Fighting enemies, which appear both in the world and in dungeons, depends on Links use of his sword and shield. Links sword moves are mapped to the direction in which the player moves the Wiimote, or makes other moves such as a lunge. By raising the Wiimote, the sword accumulates energy that can be unleashed in a wave of energy that can be used to activate environmental elements such as magic switches. The shield is controlled with the Nunchuck and can be used to reflect attacks. Links health is represented with hearts, and he takes damage each time he is hit. If all hearts are lost, the game ends.'],

It is the sixth installment in the Mario Kart series (excluding two arcade games) and the second to use Nintendos Wi-Fi connection. The game was released worldwide in April 2008. In this game, Mario and company compete in crazy, fun and crowded races in the Champi√±n Kingdom, this time with a gameplay very similar to that of the previous game, Mario Kart DS released on the Nintendo DS console. A new feature in Mario Kart Wii is that, in the game, motorcycles can also be used, in addition to karts. The game was presented during the 2007 E3 conference for Wii, shown in a trailer featuring some of the series key characters, new tracks and other details from past series. It was also shown that the controller for the game is primarily the Wiimote and that in combination with the Wii Wheel accessory it makes for a much more realistic experience for the player. In addition, one of the main features of the game is the incorporation of an online mode through Nintendos Wi-Fi connection, where the player could compete with up to 12 players at the same time, however, the connection was discontinued in 2014. In addition, many innovations have been added to the game, compared to previous versions of the Mario Kart series, where the gameplay was practically the same. Now, in Mario Kart Wii, several improvements have been added, for example, to be able to choose a Mii as a character, (which is created in the Mii Channel of the Wii console), as well as stunts of the karts or motorcycles that can be performed in the middle of the game. As mentioned above, the games main controller is the Wii Remote Controller in combination with the Wii Wheel, but it can also be played with the Nintendo GameCube Controller, the Wii Classic Controller, or simply the Wii Remote Controller in combination with the Nunchuk. In the game, the controller can be configured as manual or automatic. In the automatic mode the skidding is done automatically, but the possibility of turbocharging is lost by this system. To maneuver the controller and be able to play, you must move the Wii Wheel as if you were driving a real car. '],
